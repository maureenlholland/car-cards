This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Evergreen UI](https://evergreen.segment.com/)
- nice, clean aesthetic
- easy to use
- limited components (ie. no range input)

## Random thoughts
- Planning something as you build it is not a good strategy
- I don't know why I thought a UI library would magically make this look good. It doesn't
